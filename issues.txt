This looks better. Here are the issues that are still here:

1) In the following lines, .MSG and .OPENURL should be highlighted red but are not color coded at all.
.test3 .MSG $atccallsign($1) *** AAA - $aircraft_ $dep-$arr, $route
.COMMANDS .openurl https://refs.clevelandcenter.org/references/alias/

2) In the following line, $aircraft is color coded light purple but should be just purple but the $type() surrounding it is light purple as it should be.
.SEEAC .OPENURL https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1366&bih=606&q=$type($aircraft)+aircraft&oq=$type($aircraft)+aircraft

3) In the following line, $alt is highlighted purple while im() is not highlighted at all. I think this is because $alt is an Alias Variable but we need to be able to tell the difference between $alt and $altim()
.testAliasFunctions $altim()

4) In the following lines, $metar() and $oclock() are highlighted light purple as they should be but $dep and $arr are highlighted light purple when they should be just purple.
.testAliasFunctionsWithVariable $metar($dep)
.testAliasFunctionsWithVariable $oclock($arr)
